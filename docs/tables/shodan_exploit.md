# Table: shodan_exploit - Query Shodan Exploits using SQL

Shodan Exploits is a feature within that allows users to search for known vulnerabilities and exploits in software or hardware. It provides a comprehensive database of exploits from various sources including CVE, Metasploit, Exploit DB, and Packet Storm. Shodan Exploits helps users stay informed about potential vulnerabilities and take appropriate actions when identified.

## Table Usage Guide

The `shodan_exploit` table provides insights into known exploits within Shodan service. As a security analyst, explore exploit-specific details through this table, including descriptions, sources, and associated metadata. Utilize it to uncover information about potential vulnerabilities, such as those related to specific software or hardware, and the details of the exploits available.

**Important Notes**
- You must specify the `query` in the `where` clause to query this table.

## Examples

### Find vulnerabilities related to lodash
Uncover the details of potential vulnerabilities linked to the lodash library. This query is particularly useful for identifying potential security risks associated with the use of lodash in your applications.

```sql+postgres
select
  *
from
  shodan_exploit
where
  query = 'lodash';
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  *
from
  shodan_exploit
where
  query = 'lodash';
```

### Find exploits with Bugtraq ID
Discover the segments that are vulnerable to specific exploits by identifying instances where the Bugtraq ID is a match. This can help increase your system's security by pinpointing potential weaknesses.

```sql+postgres
select
  *
from
  shodan_exploit
where
  query = 'bid:91451';
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  *
from
  shodan_exploit
where
  query = 'bid:91451';
```

### Find exploits for a given port
Discover the vulnerabilities associated with a specific network port to enhance your cybersecurity measures and protect against potential threats.

```sql+postgres
select
  *
from
  shodan_exploit
where
  query = 'port:5432';
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  *
from
  shodan_exploit
where
  query = 'port:5432';
```
